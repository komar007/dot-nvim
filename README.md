# Neovim config

This is my everyday neovim config, used mainly for work. It was extracted from https://github.com/komar007/komar-desktop, which will hopefully get cleaned up and decentralized more one day.

The main config file is in VimL, while all plugins are configured in lua. Everything is provided in hope that it will be useful, but all in all it is just what I find useful and it's nothing but my private preferences grouped together and made public. Enjoy!
